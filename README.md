  ## Description
  When reviewing a repository on GitHub one of the most important things to review inside of the repository is the ReadMe. ReadMe's are important because it tells you what an application does, how to use it, what you need to use it, and what to do if there are problems or questions. It's also very important for your ReadMe to look professional with an easy to read flow to it. This applications goal is to streamline the process of creating a professional looking ReadMe using your terminal.
